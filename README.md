# pi7600_flutter

This will eventually be run on a custom embedded linux distro using flutter native (no x11 or wayland). The plan is to have a 1:1 app that is mobile and installed in a dashboard or tablet type setting. Similiar to how some newer cars have an app to control and monitor various aspects of their vehicle. Basically a replacement for openauto.
